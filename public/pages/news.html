                        <h3>Injury Update: Eden Hazard Ruled Out for Remainder of Season</h3>
                        <p>Real Madrid forward Eden Hazard has been ruled out for the remainder of the season after
                            suffering a hamstring injury in training. The Belgian international has struggled with
                            injuries since joining Real Madrid and this latest setback comes as a blow to both the
                            player and the club.</p>
                        <p>Manager Zinedine Zidane expressed his disappointment at the news, stating, "Eden is an
                            important player for us and it's unfortunate to lose him at this stage of the season.
                            However, we have a strong squad and I'm confident that other players will step up in his
                            absence."</p>
